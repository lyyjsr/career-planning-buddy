"""Background executor for Eval V2 experiments.

Mirrors ``AgentRunExecutor``'s in-process ``asyncio.create_task`` discipline:
``EvalService.create_experiment`` (synchronously, in the request session)
inserts the ``EvalExperiment`` + ``EvalTrial`` rows, then the HTTP handler
calls ``submit()`` here; the spawned coroutine opens its own sessions via
``self._session_factory`` and drives ``ExperimentRunner.run_experiment_and_grade``.

No multi-worker reliability is claimed (same contract as ``AgentRunExecutor``).
Recovery on startup marks any ``running`` experiment ``failed`` because
``ExperimentRunner`` itself is stateless and cannot resume mid-Trial.
