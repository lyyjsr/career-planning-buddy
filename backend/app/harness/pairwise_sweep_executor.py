"""PR-9c.2 Pairwise Sweep Executor.

Drives one Judge Sweep over its frozen SweepItem work list. The executor
is the COMMIT 3 process-side component that:

* claims work atomically (single-instance advisory lock per Sweep plus
  per-item CAS via ``status IN ('queued','running')``);
* runs ``EvalService.run_pairwise_judge`` for each (pair, position_variant)
  row using the deterministic ``judge_run_id`` already stored on the Item;
* mutates Item to ``completed`` only when a JudgeResult row exists, then
  bumps Sweep counters when the CAS transition returns ``True``;
* mutates Item to ``failed`` on control-plane errors (provider timeouts
  with no retry budget) — a Judge that returned ``invalid_structured_output``
  is STILL a real ``EvalPairwiseJudgeResult`` row, so the Item goes to
  ``completed`` with that result (per supplementary constraint #3);
* cooperatively honours ``cancel_requested_at`` between Items and marks
  remaining queued Items as ``cancelled`` (terminal), then transitions
  the Sweep to ``cancelled`` if all of its Items are terminal;
* on process restart, ``recover_interrupted`` scans Sweeps in
  ``status='running'`` and replays them — SweepItem rows ARE the work
  list, so no sampler re-run is needed.

Multi-instance safety:

* ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` keyed on a hash of the sweep id prevents two
  worker processes from acting on the same Sweep concurrently.

NOT provided here (out of scope for PR-9c.2): true Redis-style lease,
distributed lease. The advisory lock is a co-located-Postgres lease.
