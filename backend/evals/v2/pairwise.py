"""PR-9c.1 Pairwise Pair contract and authorized Judge input projection.

The Pairwise Judge compares two ``EvalTrial`` outcomes (one baseline + one
candidate) for the same ``case_id``. The Pair is the *stable identity* that
ties together one or more physical Judge executions ("runs"); each run has
its own row in ``eval_pairwise_judge_results`` (PR-9c.1 commit 2) keyed by
``judge_run_id``.

Architecture invariants (see PR-9c.1 plan):

* This module never imports ``app.harness.*`` / ``app.agent.*`` — the Eval
  Harness depends on the Agent runtime, never the reverse.
* The Judge only sees ``PairwiseJudgeInput``; the underlying
  ``baseline_trial_id`` / ``candidate_trial_id`` / model ids / auto-scores
  are deliberately absent. ``build_judge_input`` is the only constructor.
* ``PairwiseJudgeInput.input_hash`` is swap-invariant: it sorts the two
  outputs by ``canonical_sha256`` before hashing, so swapping A and B does
  not change ``input_hash``. The display order is communicated separately
  via ``position_variant`` so the Judge prompt stays positional.
