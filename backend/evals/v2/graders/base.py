"""Evidence authorization layer and base Grader abstraction.

PR-4 introduces the contract every domain Grader honours:

* a Grader declares a frozen ``allowed_evidence_kinds`` set;
* the Registry constructs an ``EvidenceView`` that filters the trial's
  ``EvidenceItem`` rows to *only* those whose ``kind`` is in that set;
* any attempt by a Grader to read an item outside its allowed kinds raises
  ``EvidenceAccessDenied`` -- for use in tests and as a guard against future
  Graders that try to peek at raw transcripts, other Graders' scores, or
  user-sensitive raw content.

The authorized view is the only object passed to ``Grader.grade``. There is no
way for a Grader to receive the underlying ``EvidenceItem`` list, the
``RunOutcome``, the ``EvalTrial``, an AsyncSession, or another Grader's
``GradeResult`` -- the spec contract "Grader 不接收完整 TrialBundle /
Repository / Session / 其他 Grader 结果".
